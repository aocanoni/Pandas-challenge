# Pandas-challenge
The folder "pandas-challenge" includes all the necessary files for my assignment submission
- Within this folder is an 'Images' folder, a 'PyCitySchools' folder, and a '.gitignore' file
- 'Images' and '.gitignore' can be ignores

The 'PyCitySchools' folder is within 'pandas-challenge' and includes a 'Resources' folder and a 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' file which is my Jupyter notebook
- 'Resources' includes a 'schools_complete.csv' file and a 'students_complete.csv' file which are the data files used for the assignment
- The 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' file is where I completed all of my work- I started off of the originally provided 'starter_code' file and input all of my code and outputs.
- The first section of the file is a written report on the data- there includes a summary and a few conclusions I made based on the data. 
- There are some outputs within the 'School Summary' section of my 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' file that are not needed for the assignment, but I provided just for clarity's sake when debugging my code and ensuring that all of the steps I made when coding resulted in the correct DataFrame.
- I included comments throughout the code as well, not including the ones provided by 'starter_code' which gave me direction during the assignment.

***The assignment provided me with code to use to calculate the mean for two different sections of my code, however both instances resulted in "FutureWarning" outputs. This should not count as an error, and does not affect my submission. 

***All of the code within this challenge is either mine or provided by 'starter_code' when I first downloaded the assignment. I did make use of Instructor help for formatting my DataFrames by removing the 'starter_code' code and replacing it with .style.format which will be seen within the file (indicated by comments specifically within the School Summary DataFrame creation section).
